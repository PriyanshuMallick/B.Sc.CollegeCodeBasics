10. Fifteen students were enrolled in a course. There ages were:

    20 20 20 20 20 21 21 21 22 22 22 22 23 23 23

    i. Find the median age of all students under 22 years

    ii. Find the median age of all students

    iii. Find the mean age of all students iv. Find the modal age for all students

    iv. Two more students enter the class. The age of both students is 23. What is now mean, mode and median?

11. Following table gives a frequency distribution of systolic blood pressure. Compute all the measures of dispersion
