# B.Sc.CollegeCodeBasics </i>👾<i>

This repository contains code examples and projects that were either assigned as practical projects in my B.Sc. in Computer Science course or are small projects that I worked on to improve my skills and learn new things and techniques in programming.

- <i>⚠️</i> Side Note: Don't read the commit messages in this repository as some of them don't make sense as they were added just for fun or as easter eggs.
