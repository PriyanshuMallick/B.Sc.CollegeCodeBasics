# Practical / Lab work to be performed for <b><i>Data Structures </i></b>

1. Write a program (using fork() and/or exec() commands) where parent and child execute
-   [Same program, same code](https://github.com/PriyanshuMallick/B.Sc.CollegeCodeBasics/blob/main/3rd_Semester/OS/Practicals/1A_fork.c)
-   [Same program, different code](https://github.com/PriyanshuMallick/B.Sc.CollegeCodeBasics/blob/main/3rd_Semester/OS/Practicals/1A_fork.c)
