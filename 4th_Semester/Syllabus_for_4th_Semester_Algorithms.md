4. Implement Randomized Quick sort (The program should report the number of comparisons)

5. Implement Radix Sort

6. Create a Red-Black Tree and perform following operations on it:
   i. Insert a node
   ii. Delete a node
   iii. Search for a number & also report the color of the node containing this number.

7. Write a program to determine the LCS of two given sequences

8. Implement Breadth-First Search in a graph

9. Implement Depth-First Search in a graph

10. Write a program to determine the minimum spanning tree of a graph

    For the algorithms at S.No 1 to 3 test run the algorithm on 100 different inputs of sizes varying from 30 to 1000. Count the number of comparisons and draw the graph. Compare it with a graph of nlogn.
