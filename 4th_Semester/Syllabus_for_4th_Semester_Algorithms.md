# Practical / Lab work to be performed for <b><i>Design and Analysis of Algorithms </i></b>

1. Implement Insertion Sort (The program should report the number of comparisons)
2. Implement Merge Sort(The program should report the number of comparisons)
3. Implement Heap Sort(The program should report the number of comparisons)
4. Implement Randomized Quick sort (The program should report the number of
   comparisons)
5. Implement Radix Sort
6. Create a Red-Black Tree and perform following operations on it:
   i. Insert a node
   ii. Delete a node
   iii. Search for a number & also report the color of the node containing this number.
7. Write a program to determine the LCS of two given sequences
8. Implement Breadth-First Search in a graph
9. Implement Depth-First Search in a graph
10. Write a program to determine the minimum spanning tree of a graph
    For the algorithms at S.No 1 to 3 test run the algorithm on 100 different inputs of sizes
    varying from 30 to 1000. Count the number of comparisons and draw the graph. Compare
    it with a graph of nlogn.
